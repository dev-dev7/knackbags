Backpack and computer bag. Roller-bag and carry-on. <\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>Each of us at Knack experienced the hassle of being burdened with multiple bags, and thought to ourselves, “I need more hands!” The epiphany was that we didn’t need more hands. We just needed a better way to carry all of our stuff. <\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>From this insight was born the vision of One Bag Life. \nWe teamed up and brought the best of what we had learned from our collective experience at Tumi, North Face, Coach, Samsonite, and eBags to design the one bag that’s clever enough to replace two.<\/p><p>  \n<\/p><p>We call it the Knack Pack, and we hope it will make it a bit easier to help you get out your front door more often so you can discover new places, meet new people, and enjoy all that’s around you.   \n<\/p>"

Links To Other Sites\nThe Site may contain links or references to other websites outside of our control. Links to other websites may use our Site logo or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These websites may send cookies to you and may collect personally identifiable information about you and make use of that data in ways that this Site would not. Please be aware that Knack has no control over these websites and that these Terms of Use do not apply to any third party sites. Knack cannot be held responsible for those sites or external sources, or for any damage or losses deriving from the use of the content, or goods and services available on those sites or external sources. Knack encourages you to read the privacy policies and terms of use linked or referenced in the websites you enter.\n10. Complaint Procedures\nIf you believe that any content or postings on this Site violates your intellectual property or other rights, please notify Knack by email at help@knackbags.com with a comprehensive detailed message setting forth the following information: (a) your name and the name of your company, if any; (b) your contact information, including your email address; (c) the nature and substance of your complaint, the specific rights at issue, and your basis for making the complaint, including the content or posting that is objectionable; and (d) the following statement: “The statements, representations, and assertions made in this message are true, complete, and accurate and I have the full legal authority to make each and every such statement, representation, and assertion and to make and be granted any demand made in this message.”\n11. Dispute Resolution\nAny dispute arising out of these Terms shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual; and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these Terms, as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. Arbitration shall take place in New York, unless Knack elects otherwise.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Knack users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Knack user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Knack will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Knack should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration and Knack will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, Knack will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Knack for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Knack on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.\nYOU AND KNACK WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Knack are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Knack over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND KNACK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth herein.\nAny rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this arbitration agreement.\nYou can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the Knack account to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\nExcept to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of New York, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.\n12. Miscellaneous\nThese Terms, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Knack and govern your use of the Site, Services and any transactions you may have with Knack through the Site and completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements or understanding, arrangements, undertaking or proposal, written or oral, between you and Knack in relation to such matters. In the event any other rule, code of conduct, or other matter posted on the Site conflicts with the terms of these Terms, these Terms of Use shall govern. No oral explanation or oral information given by any party shall alter the interpretation of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand that Knack may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use will be considered your consent to those changes. When these changes are made, Knack will make a new copy of the Terms of Use available on the Site. You agree that Knack is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to the Terms of Use. You understand that it is your responsibility to check the Terms regularly for changes.\nYou agree that if Knack does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms of Use (or which Knack has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Knack’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Knack. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide a matter arising out of these Terms, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from these Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n[Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer, Indemnity, Arbitration] Sections will survive termination of the Terms.\nThe Site is controlled and operated from within the United States. Without limiting anything else, Knack makes no representation that the Site, Site Content, User Content, services, products, information or other materials available on, in, or through the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where they are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.\nLast Updated: 8\/27\/2018",

This will involve, if you are a resident of the European Union, transferring your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA).\nMany of our external third party recipients are also based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will also involve a transfer of information outside the EEA. \nIf you are based in the European Union, whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: \n•\tWe will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.\n•\tWhere we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal information the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries. \n•\tWhere we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the U.S. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. \nPlease contact us at privacy@knackbags.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA. \n7.\tSecurity\nThe security of your personally identifiable information is important to us and Knack is committed to handling such information carefully.

Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.\nWhat we may need from you\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.\nTime limit to respond\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.

This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\nRequest correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.\nRequest erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. \nObject to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: \n•\tIf you want us to establish the information's accuracy.\n•\tWhere our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n•\tWhere you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. \n•\tYou have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. \nRequest the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. \nWithdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products and\/or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.\nUpdating this Privacy Policy\nWe reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. You should check this page periodically for changes. We will notify you of any material changes by way of a pop-up notice on the Website announcing that the Privacy Policy has changed, and pointing the changes to your attention.\nIt is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current.

Because each of us has been lucky enough to experience trips that unlocked new experiences and created new connections. We think that our destinations don’t really matter, nor how long we’re gone; what’s important is simply taking that first step out your front door. \n<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">In our world, going from point A to point B (and everywhere in between) can be spontaneous and much more fun without lugging around multiple bags. It’s why One Bag Life is so important to us. <\/p><p><\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">As we jointly build our community, we thought you’d enjoy watching a video we put together from early Knack wearers who won’t leave home without their Knack bags.<\/p>"

          "detail": "<p> The idea behind Knack came from a simple observation: wherever we looked, we noticed an epidemic of people carrying multiple bags. Work bag and a gym bag. Backpack and computer bag. Roller-bag and carry-on. <\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>Each of us at Knack experienced the hassle of being burdened with multiple bags, and thought to ourselves, “I need more hands!” The epiphany was that we didn’t need more hands. We just needed a better way to carry all of our stuff. Not only is carrying multiple bags at the same time a hassle, but it makes it extremely challenging to keep your hands free for your phone, your coffee, or even your child's hand.<\/p><p>\n<\/p><p>From this insight was born the vision of One Bag Life. \nWe teamed up and brought the best of what we had learned from our collective experience at Tumi, North Face, Coach, Samsonite, and eBags to design the one bag that’s clever enough to replace two.<\/p><p>  \n<\/p><p>We call it the Knack Pack, and we hope our patent-pending backpacks let you easily go from work to play and back again with just one bag.   \n<\/p>",
